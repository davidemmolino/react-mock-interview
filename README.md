## Instructions 

1. Build a counter feature. Don't worry about styling, just make a button and each time that you click this button a counter goes up by one.

2. Fetch data from this api https://randomuser.me/api and display it as a string on the DOM.
Either have it load on mount or have it load after a click of a button.
(Try it out using async/await ~ try/catch syntax)
(Best practice would be to put fetch logic in an external file and import it, try it out after you've finalized step 2).

3. Display fetch results as some UI component (just one result for now), display the username and picture. Style does not matter, have fun with it or not. 

4. Now that you're able to display one user, how would you go about displaying multiple users?
